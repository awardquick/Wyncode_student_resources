# Week 2 (One on One):

## Problem 1

Create a while loop that prints the square roots of the first 25 odd positive integers. The output of your program should look like this:

```
Odd has a square root which is 1.0
Odd has a square root which is 1.7320508075688772
Odd has a square root which is 2.23606797749979
Odd has a square root which is 2.6457513110645907
Odd has a square root which is 3.0
Odd has a square root which is 3.3166247903554
Odd has a square root which is 3.605551275463989
Odd has a square root which is 3.872983346207417
Odd has a square root which is 4.123105625617661
Odd has a square root which is 4.358898943540674
Odd has a square root which is 4.58257569495584
Odd has a square root which is 4.795831523312719
Odd has a square root which is 5.0
```

__Hint:__ Use `puts` to figure out what number you're currently trying to find the square root of.

## Problem 2
Create a method that returns the index of the element in an array, return -1 if the element does not exist in the array. __THIS SHOULD USE LOOPS__. It will be called like this:

```
puts element_index(element, my_array)
```

__Hint:__ Build this by iterating, get something running, then improve. Don't expect a final solution to be there after the first try.
